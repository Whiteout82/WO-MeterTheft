This is my first attempt at writing a script on my own and I'm still working some stuff out with this

--PLANNDED ADDITIONS IN NO SPECIFIC ORDER--
1. Make the police alert chance variable compared to a static 100%
2. Blacklist certain jobs from doing this(EMS/PD/DOJ)
3. Add a check if player is in vehicle to not allow action
4. Add to the config the ability to change the item to whatever you want
5. Either sync the meter deletes to all players or just add a timeout with a config to change the time on it.
